# creditscoring
The main objective for the project is create a model for a bank on whether a consumer credit  will be given or not. I will use various supervised ML model to solve the problem. The company wanted to implement a “credit scoring” tool that calculate the probability that a customer will repay it or not, then classify the request: credit granted or refused. Therefore I am required  to develop a classification algorithm to help decide whether a loan can be given to a client or not.

Also here we will give more importance to the metric 'Recall' as a bank generally does not like to give credit to people who are likely to default. In other words, we are going the choose the model with a highest Recall.
